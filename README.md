# Phone number generator
The program generates a file with all possible numbers except for repeating digits ("0000", "1111", "2222", "3333", "4444", "5555", "6666", "7777", "8888", "9999") to reduce the file size and program running time.
# How the number generator works
As easily as possible, it simply adds 1 to the current number.
## For example:
1. 230001000 
2. 230001001
3. 230001002
4. 230001003 
5. 230001004
6. 230001005
# How to improve the program
There are many ways to improve the program, some of them are
- Add a database of existing numbers
- More intelligent number generation method
- Add a lot of currentness
  
Maybe one day I will add it.
# Possible questions

| Question | Answer |
| ---- | ---- |
| Is this program legal | Yes |
| Does it break the law | No, it's just a counter at its core |
| Why are there such stupid questions here | When I showed this to my friends, some of them started saying that it's people like me who call them |

# Footnote
Don't judge me too harshly, this is my first Rust program. It's about the principle of programming.
